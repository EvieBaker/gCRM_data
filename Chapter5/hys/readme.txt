The hysteresis files include the FORC files (.frc), the hysteresis loops (.hys), the backfield curves (.coe). For the hysteresis measurements measured on the VSM at University of Southampton, the file type is in the name not extension.

The files are split into folders whether they were measured on the AGM or VSM.
