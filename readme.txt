This folder contains the relevant data files for my thesis. 
It is split into the Chapters.

The data for Chapter 3 includes the gCRM palaeointensity method with the user input.

The data for Chapter 4 is at the doi: https:// doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7428933 as outlined in the Data availability statement in the thesis.

The Chapter 5 folder contains the sediment and concretion samples with the raw data files for the measurements in folders. These folders are for remanence measurements (REM), high-temperature suscpeptbility (highT), low-temperature magnetic (lowT), hysteresis (hys), SEM-EDX and XRD.

The Chapter 6 folder contains the raw data files for the magnetic measurements, the NRM, SIRM, XRD and hysteresis files in different folders. 

The Chapter 7 folder contains the graphical Preisach gCRM palaeointensity results for each of the tested samples which weren't shown in the thesis. It also includes the code used for testing the two different growth mechanisms (nucleate same (NS) and growth same (GS) methods).
